**Task: Backend - Transaction Management API Development**

**Description:**

Implement the backend API endpoints for managing mutual fund transactions. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting transactions.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement API endpoints for:
    *   Adding a new transaction
    *   Retrieving a transaction by ID
    *   Updating an existing transaction
    *   Deleting a transaction
    *   Listing all transactions for a user
*   Use Supabase for the backend implementation.
*   Use PostgreSQL for the database.
*   Implement proper data validation and error handling.
*   Secure the API endpoints with authentication.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The API endpoints should be functional and perform the required operations correctly.
*   Data validation should prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.
*   Error handling should provide informative error messages.
*   The API endpoints should be secured and only accessible to authenticated users.
*   The API should be well-documented.
