**Task: Frontend - CSV Upload Interface Development**

**Description:**

Implement the CSV upload interface for the Mutual Fund Tracker application. This interface should allow users to upload transaction data from CSV files.

**Requirements:**

*   Provide a file upload field for users to select a CSV file.
*   Implement client-side validation to ensure that the selected file is a CSV file.
*   Display a preview of the CSV data before uploading.
*   Allow users to map the CSV columns to the corresponding transaction fields (fund name, date, type, units, price).
*   Implement error handling for invalid CSV data.
*   Use Angular for the frontend implementation.
*   Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The file upload field should be easy to use and clearly labeled.
*   Client-side validation should prevent users from uploading non-CSV files.
*   The CSV data preview should be accurate and display the data in a readable format.
*   Users should be able to easily map the CSV columns to the transaction fields.
*   Error handling should provide informative messages for invalid CSV data.
*   The uploaded CSV data should be sent to the backend for processing.
*   The layout should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
