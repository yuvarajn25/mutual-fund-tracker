**Task: Testing**

**Description:**

Implement unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) for the Mutual Fund Tracker application to ensure its quality and reliability.

**Requirements:**

*   Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., CSV parser, API integration) to verify their functionality.
*   Create integration tests to verify the interaction between different components (e.g., transaction management, NAV data fetching).
*   Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with end-users to ensure that the application meets their requirements.
*   Use appropriate testing frameworks and tools.
*   Document the testing process and results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   All critical components should have adequate unit test coverage.
*   Integration tests should verify the correct interaction between different components.
*   UAT should be conducted with representative users and should cover all major use cases.
*   All identified bugs should be fixed before the application is released.
*   The testing process should be well-documented.
