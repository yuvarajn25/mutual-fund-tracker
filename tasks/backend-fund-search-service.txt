**Task: Backend - Mutual Fund Search Service Development**

**Description:**

Develop a service to search for mutual funds using the external API ([https://api.mfapi.in/mf/search?q=IDF](https://api.mfapi.in/mf/search?q=IDF)). This service will allow users to find and add new mutual funds to their portfolio.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement a service to call the external API with a search query.
*   Parse the API response and extract the fund details (fund name, fund code, etc.).
*   Allow users to select a fund from the search results and add it to their portfolio.
*   Store the fund details in the database.
*   Implement error handling for API requests.
*   Use Supabase for the backend implementation.
*   Use PostgreSQL for the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The service should return accurate search results based on the user's query.
*   Users should be able to easily add new funds to their portfolio from the search results.
*   Fund details should be stored correctly in the database.
*   Error handling should prevent the service from crashing due to API errors.
