**Task: Backend - NAV Data Fetching Service Development**

**Description:**

Develop a service to fetch NAV (Net Asset Value) data from the external API ([https://api.mfapi.in/mf/148035/latest](https://api.mfapi.in/mf/148035/latest)) and store it in the database.

**Requirements:**

*   Implement a service to periodically call the external API for each tracked fund.
*   Parse the API response and extract the NAV data.
*   Store the NAV data in the database, including the fund ID, NAV date, and NAV value.
*   Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API requests.
*   Consider caching NAV data to reduce API calls and improve performance.
*   Use Supabase for the backend implementation.
*   Use PostgreSQL for the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The service should fetch NAV data automatically and store it in the database.
*   The fetched NAV data should be accurate and up-to-date.
*   Error handling should prevent the service from crashing due to API errors.
*   Caching should reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
*   The service should be scalable and able to handle a large number of tracked funds.
